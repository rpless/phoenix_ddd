# Running the App.
To start your Phoenix app:

  1. Make sure you have a running Postgres instance.
  2. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  3. Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  4. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
